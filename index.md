## About

I'm a newbie to Vue.js, but I have a good feeling about it. I want to learn it!

I noticed three closed issues regarding requests for a PDF of the documentation, none of which actually yielded a PDF of the documentation. But I really wanted to a PDF, so I made one. This documentation is Macgyvered together from the markdown files in the vuejs.org repo. I renamed the files so that they would alphabatize, concatenated them, loaded the concatenated markdown into Dillinger and saved it as a PDF. But wait... the PDF was more than 400 pages long with not very many words per page... so I continued tried a different strategy. 

I installed pandoc.. which alas wouldn't install properly on my upgraded MacOS. found another computer... successfully installe pandoc, converted the concatenated markdown file to a Word document where I modified it to be multi-column. And I've sent it off to the print shop, where I'll pick up a bound copy on Sunday.
